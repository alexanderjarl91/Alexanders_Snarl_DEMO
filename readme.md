Project description:

After talking to the teachers I decided to start a frontpage for a small project. The idea is to make a publicly accessible database of my favorite recipes.
Eventually I want to build a module that scrolls through recipes from left to right with filter capabilities (user can search for ingredients he already has in his fridge to see what can be made with it) and more. 


Technical description:
Page is designed in figma, built with HTML and styled with SASS. The frontpage uses 5 features of SASS that I like. I learned how to use the features as I went so some could have been used earlier in the file ^.^. 

All SASS features are marked with comments in the .scss files.
